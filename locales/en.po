msgid "About content 1"
msgstr "I, Iris A. Faleide, am a native Norwegian, experienced translator and content
writer with a diverse background. Having achieved the highest grades in English and
Norwegian through high school, I've continued on to working in the United States,
Australia and New Zealand. This allowed me to gain in-depth knowledge of the
English language, an asset that has since proved to be a great strength."

msgid "About content 2"
msgstr "Taking on the position as PA for the CEO of HTH AS, Fred Karlsen,
I've gained invaluable experience in working in a large scale company,
and became season in translating company material,
writing and translating ads, newsletters, web content, commercial material,
radio spots, tv ads and legal contracts. Due to my extensive experience in retail, I have
aquired skills in customizing content to desired target groups."

msgid "About content 3"
msgstr "After years of working freelance through various translation agencies, I've
realized that not only do companies keep most of the project fees, it also creates
a distance between the client and the translator that could potentially affect the translation
quality. The translator has no direct contact with the client."

msgid "About content 4"
msgstr "By eliminating the expensive middlemen, I am able to offer my clients a lower
rate, personal follow-up on each project, and a guarantee that your translations are never
partly automated - simply 100 percent human translation. This creates a constant flow in the language
and avoids unnatural sentence structures."

msgid "About content 5"
msgstr "In addition to working as a translator, I also work as a volunteer and travel
writer. Working as a freelancer enables me to fund my volunteering, and by primarily
working in countries with a lower cost of living than Scandinavia, also makes it
possible to keep the pricing at a lower raite without sacrificing quality."
